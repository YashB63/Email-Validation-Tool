# Email-Validation-Tool
An email validation tool is a program or script that uses regular expressions to check whether an email address is valid or not. 
Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and can be used to validate email addresses by matching them against a specific pattern.

Email validation tools are useful for businesses and individuals who rely on email communication for marketing, customer support, or other purposes. 
By validating email addresses, they can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of their email campaigns and reduce the risk of bounced emails and spam complaints.
